## 📚 Architecture & Reusability

This project follows a modular code structure where components are reusable and organized by functionality. The animations, transitions, and interactions are designed to be decoupled from the UI components, making it easy to maintain and extend. Here's a brief breakdown of the main components:

- **ScrollTrigger**: A custom hook for managing scroll-triggered animations.
- **VideoPlayer**: A reusable video player component that can be integrated seamlessly into the flow.
- **HoverEffects**: A collection of 3D hover effect components.
- **Transitions**: A set of CSS transitions and animations designed for smooth user interactions.
